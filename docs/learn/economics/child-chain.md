In order to operate a child chain in Tokamak Network, the operator must stake more than a certain amount of TON. The minimum amount required is $D_{min}$, excluding delegated TON. As long as the child chain is operating, the operator can only unstake the remaining amount except $D_{min}$. Delegators do not have a minimum required amount and have no restrictions on the amount of undelegation.
