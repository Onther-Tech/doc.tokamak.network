## What are TONs?
TON is the native token of Tokamak Network which acts like Ether within the Etheruem ecosystem.

TON has 18 decimal points and the lowest unit is called Poon. TON is the equivalent unit to BTC or ETH, and Poon is similar to satoshi or wei.


| Unit | Decimal Places |
| ---- |:--------------:|
| Poon |       0        |
| TON  |       18       |


## What are the uses of TONs?
TONs serve the following three core functions in Tokamak Network: i) to be used for deposit in order to ensure the security of a child chain, ii) to be used as transaction fees within the child chain, and iii) to be used to participate in PowerTON.


### Staking
Ton is used when deploying child chains and connecting them to Tokamak Network. Child chain operators must deposit more than a certain amount of TON to deploy and connect the child chain to the Tokamak Network.

### PowerTON
TON is also used to participate in the PowerTON game. PowerTon is a gamified method to distribute unissued commit reward from staking, which can only be played through TON.

### Stamina
TON, along with other tokens, can be used to pay transaction fees in child chains. Anyone can deposit TON to create Stamina, which also can be paid as transaction fees. What's different about Stamina is that it is not entirely consumed after payment, and recovers after a certain period. It can also be delegated to a third party.

### Challenge
TON provides cryptoeconomic incentives for all child chains to operate securely. Operators participating in Tokamak Network must deposit a certain amount of TON to perform a particular action and may be challenged if they act against a predetermined rule. If the challenge is proven true, the deposit will be slashed the entire or some amount will go to the challenger as a reward, with the remaining amount burned if there is any.


## Staking, Delegating and Commit

**Staking** is depositing a certain amount of TON to connect a child chain. By staking, the operator can run a child chain and take profit from the commit reward.

**Unstaking** is withdrawing some or all of the staked TON.

**Delegating** is delegating TON to another staker. Delegators can take a portion of the profit from commit reward, but cannot participate in operating the child chain. Delegated TONs are added to the total amount of staked TONs, which is a key parameter for determining further issuance of TON.

**Undelegating** is withdrawing delegated TONs.

**Commit** is recording roots of blocks of child chain by submitting them to the root chain. Additional TON is issued per commit as a reward. Committing can be perceived as block mining or validating on other blockchains.

**Enter** is transferring an asset or state from the root chain to the child chain. When TON is entered, a portion of the amount is added to the total amount of TON staked on the child chain, just like when a TON is delegated.
