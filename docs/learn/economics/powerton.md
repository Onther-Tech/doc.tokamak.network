## What is PowerTON?
PowerTON is a way that distributes part of a commit reward that has not been issued through staking. The purpose of PowerTON is to increase the economic incentive for the operation of child chains by providing additional rewards to participants who contribute to the network through commit. Power is issued on the basis of contribution to the network, the same as the distribution of commit reward, thereby distributing additional reward. Power is not available for purchase or transaction and can only be obtained through contributing to the Tokamak Network.

(updated in October, 2021) PowerTON contract has been replaced by PowerTONSwapper contract via [DAO mandate](https://dao.tokamak.network/#/agenda/5). This change solves the issue of TON dilution for users with small amount of staking and allows a method for swapping their reward to TOS, the tonstarter platform token, and provide new incentive to commit.
