## Account Model of Tokamak Plasma

The biggest problem with old plasma solutions is that they had a different transaction execution model from Ethereum. That is why additional effort is required when porting dapps on Ethereum to plasma chain. However, because Tokamak Plasma uses the same model as Ethereum, existing dapps can be migrated without additional effort.


### Development Tool and Environment

Plasma chains of Tokamak Network have the same structure as Ethereum. Development tools and frameworks of Ethereum, such as Metamask, Truffle, and Solidity can be used without any change.


## Transaction Fee

In Tokamak Network, users can deposit TON to obtain Stamina, the right to generate transactions on child chains. However, stamina is essentially different from gas in that third parties can pay on behalf of you and is restored after a certain period. In other words, users can send transactions without worrying about fees if they deposit a certain amount of stamina or if someone else pays for them.
